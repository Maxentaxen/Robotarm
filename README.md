# Robot arm
This repository contains the code for the robot arm project
The idea of this project is to have a few servos that can control an arm to direct it to a specified point. 


## ยง1. The math
There's quite a bit of math going on in this project but here's where it will be explained.

### ยง1.1. The main equation
This equation is what the entire project is based upon. Solving it is what allows the program to find the angles
to put the servos into. \
\
$`
L_1\begin{bmatrix} \cos(\alpha_1) \\ \sin(\alpha_1) \end{bmatrix} + L_2\begin{bmatrix} \cos(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2) \\ \sin(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2) \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \end{bmatrix} 
`$ 

\
where $`L_1, L_2`$ are the lenghts of the segments and
$`\alpha_1, \alpha_2`$ are the joint angles measured up from the xy-plane rotated up by some angle in some direction.
Solving this equation is not that hard, the only other thing we need to know is that $\alpha_1+\alpha_2 = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)$ which can be seen easily in a diagram.

### ยง1.2. Making it 3d
Finding joint angles in 2 dimensions is great and all but we want this to be able to move in 3d-space. This only really adds one step to the processing and it's not that complicated.\
The only thing needed is to convert the 3d-problem into a 2d-problem. This is accomplished by converting the target point's cartesian coordinates $(x, y, z)$ into cylindrical coordinates $(r, \theta, h)$ where r is the radial distance from the z-axis, $\theta$ is the angle about the z-axis measured counterclockwise from the positive x-axis and h is the height above the xy-plane. This is achieved using the following equation:

$`\begin{bmatrix} 
              r \\ 
              \theta \\ 
              h 
  \end{bmatrix} =\begin{bmatrix} 
              \sqrt{x^2+y^2} \\
              \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{y}{x}\right) \\ 
              z \end{bmatrix}`$\
\
After that, we use our main equation using $(r,h)$ as our target point and then simply rotate the base to achieve the correct $\theta$.
 

## ยง2. Components
The user of the project must be able to input a point that the arm is to move to. There are two parts to this:

### 2.1. Servo motors
The project just needs 3 servo motors.

### 2.2. A computer
You need a computer with the arduino IDE in order to communicate with the system
